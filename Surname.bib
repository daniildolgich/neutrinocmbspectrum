 abstract = "{Measurements of the effective zenith noise temperature of the 20-foot
horn-reflector antenna (Crawford, Hogg, and Hunt 1961) at the Crawford
Hill Laboratory, Holmdel, New Jersey, at 4080 Mc/s have yielded a value
of about 3.5 K higher than expected. This excess temperature is, within
the limits of our observations, isotropic, unpolarized, and free from
seasonal variations (July, 1964 - April, 1965). A possible explanation
for the observed excess noise temperature is the one given by Dicke,
Peebles, Roll, and Wilkinson (1965) in a companion letter in this issue.
